  # Budget on the Go
  
  ## Description

  Ever been in a situation where you cannot recall what you spent money on? Have you gone through your bank statements and wished you could also review the items you never received receipts for? Look no further! For the final team project of the ESMT Coding Bootcamp, our team designed an interactive MERN Stack single-page application that allows you to track your expenses on the go. "Budget on the Go" is a mobile-first application that supports user authentication, stores and updates user data and connects to a MongoDB database.
